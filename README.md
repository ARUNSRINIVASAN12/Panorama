# Panorama

This script automates the process of creating a panorama by loading and resizing images from a specified directory ("panorama") and using OpenCV's Stitcher class to stitch them together. It's a simple yet effective approach to generate panoramas from a series of images stored in a folder. Adjustments can be made to handle more complex cases, such as varying image orientations or exposure levels, to improve the stitching results further based on specific needs.
